# Vulnerable Service Walkthrough

## What is a Service in Android?
A Service component is used to perform background tasks, this means it has no user interface and does not need any user input. An example of a Service would be playing music, you are still able to use other apps on the phone while music is playing as it is running in the background. There are three types of Services which are as following.


Background Service:\
A background Service is not noticed by the user when it is running.


Foreground Service:\
A foreground Service will always display a notificaiton to the user so the user knows it is running.

Bound Service:\
A bound Service allows other app comopnents to bind onto it. What it means for component to bind to a service is that component can then interact with the Service and do things such as request and receive data.
