# VulnerableAndroidApplication
Vulnerable Android Applications is a tool to learn how to find vulnerabilites within you own Android Applications and how to fix them. The vulnerabilites are based on Android components which are:
* Actvity
* Service
* Broadcast Receiver
* Content Provider


This tool contains two vulnerable apps. These are a vulnerable Banking app and a vulnerable SMS messaging app. As these apps work and function as real apps they are to help show what are the dangers of these vulnerabilites.


There are four walkthroughs, one for each component. The walkthrough gives you information about the component and its vulnerabiltiym, how to exploit the vulnerability and how to fix it. You can find these walkthoughs [here.](https://github.com/FraserGrandfield/VulnerableAndroidApplication/tree/main/Walkthroughs)
